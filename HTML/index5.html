    <h2>When you feel tired</h2>
    <p>
      Take a breath my lovely boy. You don’t have to do everything today.
      Rest is not giving up, take some time for you.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="diary-card">
    <h2>When you feel bad</h2>
    <p>
      Bad days don’t define you.
      They pass, even if it doesn’t feel like it right now. Your life is not deined by one bad day, and even if the days 
        stay bad, it's like a roller coaster, it will go up in a moment !
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="diary-card">
    <h2>When you feel alone</h2>
    <p>
      You are not invisible. I'm with you, in your heart and in your mind.
      Someone cares, I care, even if it’s just this page right now, you will awlays have people even if you don't see them,
        they see you.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="diary-card">
    <h2>When you feel dumb</h2>
    <p>
      You are learning. Every. Single. Day. You are not an end, you're a start. And everyday you start differently.
      Intelligence is not speed, it’s persistence and consistance. You are intelligent and you have capacity. Even if you don't
        see them, people see them, so don't doubt.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="diary-card">
    <h2>When you need a hug & a kiss</h2>
    <p>
      Imagine warm arms around you, soft lips against your cheeks. Because even if I can't be with you now, my heart is still for you.
      You are safe. You are loved. I love you and I will still do tomorrow morning and each mornings after. 💞
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="diary-card">
    <h2>When you feel good</h2>
    <p>
      Remember this feeling. And try your best to keep it. That's good, I'm proud of you.
      You deserve moments like this, more than you think. You deserve happiness. Don't give up, I believe in you and in
        the goals you want to achieve. You can do anything, you just have to believe in you just as I do !
